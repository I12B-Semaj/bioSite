        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>
            Jocelyn Gramajo, was born as Jocelyn Kay Leniger on December 24, 1992 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
            She grew up back and forth from Nebraska to Oklahoma. She met a lot of people while being raised 
            in these two states. In Nebraska she met a couple of her really close friends, Jackie, and Abbey, 
            who still live in Nebraska to this day. Jocelyn also has a best friend named Lacie who she met in 
            Oklahoma. Jocelyn is still in touch with all of her very close friends to this day. In Nebraska 
            she also met a woman named Stephanie, who took on a motherly-role and helped shape who she was as 
            a person growing up. Despite not being Jocelyn’s biological mother, Stephanie would spend so much 
            time with Jocelyn that it was almost impossible for this relationship between them to not form.

            Oklahoma is where the majority of her family is located. Her grandmother, who to Jocelyn, is 
            considered to be the most influential person to her as a child lives in Oklahoma. Jocelyn believes 
            the reason her grandmother was so influential was due to the fact that her grandmother was always 
            herself, meaning she never faked her personality a day in her life. 
            “She always knew exactly who she was and always stood by her convictions.”
            Jocelyn also met her current husband, Brander in Oklahoma. Jocelyn and Brander first met at an indoor soccer event through mutual friends. These meetings continue to transpire over a 5-month period in which Brander had made attempts to land a date which eventually came to fruition and took place over lunch at a restaurant named, Café Cacao. These two are now married and settled down with a business, a home, and five beautiful children. Jocelyn considers all of these life events to be the accomplishments that she is most proud of.
            “I am proud of being a mom, wife, and business owner. I was able to accomplish all of this in my 20s. I think it pretty kick and ass and I hope to keep up this momentum.”
            This momentum certainly will be kept up as she takes an interest in watching videos of homesteaders on YouTube, as this is a lifestyle, she hopes to one day engage in with her family. Jocelyn’s definition of happiness is being grounded, being able to handle situations as they come, and see the positive, no matter how difficult or frustrating these situations may be. As long as you can maintain feeling light and not weighed down with burden, you have achieved happiness.
